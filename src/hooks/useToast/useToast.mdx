# useToast()

`useToast()` is a hook used to display toast notifications from your component.

```tsx
import { useToast } from '@unsignd/uuuui';

function Component() {
  const toast = useToast();
  //...
```

## Usage

<br />

#### `toast()`: (text: string) => void

Displays a generic toast notification with the given text. This can be used for general information or messages that do not fall under specific categories like success, error, or warning. Check the [Example](/story/hook-usetoast--default).

```tsx
toast('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

<hr />

#### `toast.success()`: (text: string) => void

Displays a success toast notification with the given text. This is typically used to inform the user that an action has been successfully completed, such as saving data or completing a task. Check the [Example](/story/hook-usetoast--success).

```tsx
toast.success('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

<hr />

#### `toast.error()`: (text: string) => void

Displays an error toast notification with the given text. This is used to alert the user that something went wrong, such as a failed operation or an unexpected error. Check the [Example](/story/hook-usetoast--error).

```tsx
toast.error('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

<hr />

#### `toast.warning()`: (text: string) => void

Displays a warning toast notification with the given text. This is used to caution the user about potential issues or important information that they should be aware of, but that does not necessarily indicate an error. Check the [Example](/story/hook-usetoast--warning).

```tsx
toast.warning('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

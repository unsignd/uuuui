# useToast()

`useToast()` is a hook used to display toast notifications from your component.

import { useToast } from '@unsignd/uuuui';

function Component() {
  const toast = useToast();
  //...
```

## Usage

<br />

#### `toast(text: string)`

Displays a generic toast notification with the given text. This can be used for general information or messages that do not fall under specific categories like success, error, or warning. You can see an example on [<ins>Hook/useToast/Default</ins>](/story/hook-usetoast--default).

```tsx
toast('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

<hr />

#### `toast.success(text: string)`

Displays a success toast notification with the given text. This is typically used to inform the user that an action has been successfully completed, such as saving data or completing a task. You can see an example on [<ins>Hook/useToast/Success</ins>](/story/hook-usetoast--success).

```tsx
toast.success('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

<hr />

#### `toast.error(text: string)`

Displays an error toast notification with the given text. This is used to alert the user that something went wrong, such as a failed operation or an unexpected error. You can see an example on [<ins>Hook/useToast/Error</ins>](/story/hook-usetoast--error).

```tsx
toast.error('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```

<hr />

#### `toast.warning(text: string)`

Displays a warning toast notification with the given text. This is used to caution the user about potential issues or important information that they should be aware of, but that does not necessarily indicate an error. You can see an example on [<ins>Hook/useToast/Warning</ins>](/story/hook-usetoast--warning).

```tsx
toast.warning('Hi, this is a Toast.');
```
